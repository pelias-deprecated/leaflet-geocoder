Leaflet + Pelias geocoding plugin (deprecated)
=====================================================

A plugin that adds the ability to search (geocode) a Leaflet-powered map using [Pelias](https://pelias.io) with a hosted service such as [geocode.earth](https://geocode.earth) or your own hosted version of the Pelias Geocoder.

## This package has been renamed.

It is now called **nextzen/leaflet-geocoder**.

The repository is here: https://github.com/nextzen/leaflet-geocoder
