Leaflet + Mapzen Search geocoding plugin (deprecated)
=====================================================

A plugin that adds the ability to search (geocode) a Leaflet-powered map using [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/projects/search) or your own hosted version of the [Pelias Geocoder API](https://github.com/pelias/api).

## This package has been renamed.

It is now called **leaflet-geocoder-mapzen**.

The repository is here: https://github.com/mapzen/leaflet-geocoder

The new npm package location can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-geocoder-mapzen

For more information about migrating, please see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mapzen/leaflet-geocoder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#project-name-change).

### Why did we do this?

This plugin was designed for "getting started" in mind. Most users have signed up for API keys with [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/projects/search) and want to put a geocoder UI on their map application with a minimal amount of hassle. In the interest of keeping a clear distinguishing line between Mapzen Search (the hosted service with an API key) and Pelias (the open-source geocoding engine) we felt that naming the project this way would be less confusing. And we wanted to do it earlier rather than later.
